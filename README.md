# Feed Me

Author: **Huy Dang**

Ever wished your plants could tell you when they need watering? Well, with an Arduino they can! In this lab, you’ll create an Arduino-powered plant monitor, all coded in C. Here’s what you’re going to build.

The plant monitor has a moisture sensor that measures how wet your plant’s soil is. If the plant needs watering, an LED lights up until the plant’s been watered, and the string “Feed me!” is repeatedly sent to your computer.
When the plant has been watered, the LED switches off and the string “Thank you, Seymour!” is sent once to your computer.

This is a C-lab challenge from "Head First C" book.
